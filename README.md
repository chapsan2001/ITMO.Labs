**ATTENTION!** Python labs contain some unnoticed mistakes. I didn't have time to find and fix them,
but I still got a lot of points for them, because the teacher didn't even ask me anything about the labs
and gave me nearly maximum points, so now I have no desire to fix them :)

As long as I'm studying at the university, new laboratory works will be uploaded.
