# ITMO.Labs
This repository contains my laboratory works for programming lessons at ITMO University.

Java labs are done using **IntelliJ IDEA** by *JetBrains*.

- Fall semester 2019
  - Maths lab - 10/10 points;
  - Pokemon lab - 9.9/10 points;
  - Text model lab 1 - 9/10 points;
  - Text model lab 2 - 9/10 points;
- Spring semester 2020
  - Collection managment application lab - 9/10 points;
  - Client-server architecture lab - 8/10 points;
  - Database lab - TBD.
  
Points for Java labs were given mostly for theory knowledge, tecnical completion costs only 0.01 points.

Tasks can be found at https://se.ifmo.ru/courses/programming (there are different variants, so you probably won't find exactly my tasks).

Python labs are done using **PyCharm** by *JetBrains*.
- I/O lab - 7.63/8 points;
- Branching, cycles, lists and strings lab - 3.75/4 points;
- Corteges, multitudes, dictionaries, functions and files lab - 4/4 points;
- Object oriented programming lab - 4/4 points.

Tasks can be found at https://books.ifmo.ru/file/pdf/2256.pdf

**ATTENTION!** Python labs contain some unnoticed mistakes. I didn't have time to find and fix them,
but I still got a lot of points for them, because the teacher didn't even ask me anything about the labs
and gave me nearly maximum points, so now I have no desire to fix them :)

As long as I'm studying at the university, new laboratory works will be uploaded.
